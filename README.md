# ChessBadge

ChessBadge is a Chzzk-first chess rating chat overlay for streamers.

## Stack

- Frontend: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Fastify, TypeScript
- Database/Auth: Cloud Firestore, Firebase Authentication
- Firebase access: Firebase Admin SDK on the server, Firebase Web SDK for auth
- Realtime: SSE first, WebSocket later if needed
- Deploy target: ECS Fargate

## Repository Layout

```text
apps/
  server/   Fastify API, Chzzk ingestion, SSE gateway, jobs
  web/      React/Vite dashboard and OBS overlay UI
packages/
  core/     Shared domain types and rating rules
docs/       Architecture and Firestore data model
```

The browser does not access Firestore directly. React authenticates with Firebase,
then calls the Fastify API. Fastify verifies the Firebase ID token and accesses
Firestore through the Admin SDK.

## Chzzk Login Flow

```text
GET /api/auth/chzzk/start
  -> Chzzk OAuth
  -> GET /open/v1/users/me
  -> Firestore user upsert
  -> Firebase Custom Token creation
  -> web callback with a short-lived one-time code
  -> POST /api/auth/firebase/exchange
  -> Firebase browser sign-in
```

The Custom Token is never placed in the callback URL. The one-time login code is
kept in server memory for two minutes and can be consumed only once. This is valid
for the single-task MVP. Move the exchange store to Redis before running multiple
ECS tasks.

Use `GET /api/firebase/status` to verify both Firebase Authentication and Firestore
server connectivity.

## First Milestone

The first product risk to remove is Chzzk chat ingestion:

1. Complete Chzzk OAuth.
2. Create a Chzzk chat session.
3. Subscribe to chat events.
4. Print `senderChannelId`, `nickname`, `content`, and `messageTime`.
5. Forward those events to `/events/test` via SSE.

## Firebase Setup

1. Create a Firebase project.
2. Enable Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore.
3. Create a service account for the Fastify server.
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the Firebase values.
5. Deploy `firestore.rules` before allowing production traffic.

The existing Chzzk chat proof of concept still runs without Firebase credentials.
Firebase is initialized lazily when an auth or database feature first uses it.
