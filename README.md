# ChessBadge

ChessBadge is a Chzzk-first chess rating chat overlay for streamers.

## Stack

- Frontend: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Fastify, TypeScript
- Database/Auth: Cloud Firestore, Firebase Authentication
- Firebase access: Firebase Admin SDK on the server, Firebase Web SDK for auth
- Realtime: SSE first, WebSocket later if needed
- Deploy target: ECS Fargate

## Repository Layout

  server/   Fastify API, Chzzk ingestion, SSE gateway, jobs

```

The browser does not access Firestore directly. React authenticates with Firebase,
then calls the Fastify API. Fastify verifies the Firebase ID token and accesses
Firestore through the Admin SDK.

## Chzzk Login Flow

```text
GET /api/auth/chzzk/start?mode=streamer|viewer
  -> Chzzk OAuth
  -> GET /open/v1/users/me
  -> users and chzzkAccounts upsert
  -> streamer mode only: streamers upsert and chat session start
  -> Firebase Custom Token creation
  -> web callback with a short-lived one-time code
  -> POST /api/auth/firebase/exchange
  -> Firebase browser sign-in
```

Both modes create the same Firebase user and Chzzk account mapping. Viewer mode
does not create a streamer record or start a Chzzk chat session. A user can be
both a viewer and a streamer; logging in as a viewer does not remove an existing
streamer record.

Viewer OAuth credentials are used only to call Chzzk's current-user API during
the callback and are not persisted. Streamer access and refresh tokens are
encrypted with AES-256-GCM before being stored in Firestore. The active streamer
access token also lives in the in-memory chat session and is cleared when that
session stops. The server schedules a refresh five minutes before access-token
expiration, atomically writes both newly issued tokens, and updates the active
chat session. A rejected refresh token marks the streamer as requiring login.

The refresh scheduler and duplicate-refresh guard currently live in process
memory. Run one server task for the MVP; distributed coordination is required
before multiple ECS tasks can refresh the same one-time token safely.

The Custom Token is never placed in the callback URL. The one-time login code is
kept in server memory for two minutes and can be consumed only once. This is valid
for the single-task MVP. Move the exchange store to Redis before running multiple
ECS tasks.

Use `GET /api/firebase/status` to verify both Firebase Authentication and Firestore
server connectivity.

## Authenticated API

After Firebase browser sign-in, React sends the current Firebase ID Token to
Fastify on every protected request:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <firebase-id-token>
```

Fastify verifies the token with the Firebase Admin SDK and exposes the verified
`uid`, `provider`, and `chzzkChannelId` to route handlers. The current protected
endpoints are:

```text
GET  /api/me
GET  /api/chzzk/session/status
POST /api/chzzk/session/stop
```

The Chzzk session manager also records the owning Firebase UID, so an authenticated
user cannot inspect or stop another user's active session.

## First Milestone

The first product risk to remove is Chzzk chat ingestion:

1. Complete Chzzk OAuth.
2. Create a Chzzk chat session.
3. Subscribe to chat events.
4. Print `senderChannelId`, `nickname`, `content`, and `messageTime`.
5. Forward those events to `/events/test` via SSE.

## Firebase Setup

1. Create a Firebase project.
2. Enable Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore.
3. Create a service account for the Fastify server.
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the Firebase values.
5. Deploy `firestore.rules` before allowing production traffic.

The existing Chzzk chat proof of concept still runs without Firebase credentials.
Firebase is initialized lazily when an auth or database feature first uses it.
