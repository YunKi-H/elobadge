# Lightsail Deployment

This deployment runs one ChessBadge application container behind Caddy on a
Lightsail Linux instance. Keep exactly one application container until the
in-memory OAuth exchange and realtime event state move to shared infrastructure.

## 1. Prepare the Domain and GitHub Repository

Choose the production hostname, for example `badge.example.com`.

In the GitHub repository, add these Actions secrets under **Settings > Secrets
and variables > Actions**:

```text
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID
```

These values become part of the public browser bundle; the `secret` setting only
prevents accidental exposure in build logs. Never add Firebase Admin credentials
or Chzzk secrets as Docker build arguments.

Push to `main` or manually run the **Build container** workflow. It publishes:

```text
ghcr.io/yunki-h/chessbadge:latest
ghcr.io/yunki-h/chessbadge:sha-<commit>
```

Make the GHCR package public. If it must remain private, authenticate Docker on
the server with a GitHub token that has only `read:packages` permission.

## 2. Create the Lightsail Instance

1. Create an Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Linux instance with at least 1 GB memory.
2. Attach a Lightsail static IPv4 address.
3. Allow TCP ports 80 and 443 and UDP port 443 in the Lightsail firewall.
4. Restrict TCP port 22 to the administrator's IP where practical.
5. Point the hostname's DNS `A` record to the static IPv4 address.

Do not expose Fastify port 3000 in the Lightsail firewall. It is reachable only
from Caddy inside the Compose network.

## 3. Install Docker

Connect over SSH and install Docker from Ubuntu packages:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker.io docker-compose-v2 git
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
sudo usermod -aG docker "$USER"
```

Log out and reconnect once so the Docker group membership takes effect.

## 4. Configure the Service

Clone the repository and create the runtime environment file:

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /opt/chessbadge
sudo chown "$USER":"$USER" /opt/chessbadge
git clone https://github.com/YunKi-H/chessbadge.git /opt/chessbadge/repository
cd /opt/chessbadge/repository/deploy
cp .env.example .env
chmod 600 .env
```

Edit `deploy/.env`. At minimum, replace every empty value and example domain.
Keep `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` on one line with literal `\n` sequences. Generate the
token encryption key with:

```sh
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Use the generated value for `CHZZK_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. Do not rotate this key
after streamer tokens have been stored unless every streamer will log in again.

Start the containers:

```sh
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
docker compose logs --tail=100 app caddy
```

Caddy requests and renews the TLS certificate automatically after DNS resolves
to the instance and ports 80 and 443 are reachable.

## 5. Update OAuth and Firebase

Set the Chzzk developer console callback URL to:

```text
https://badge.example.com/api/auth/chzzk/callback
```

The same value must be stored in `CHZZK_REDIRECT_URI`. Add the production
hostname to **Firebase Authentication > Settings > Authorized domains**.

Verify these flows after deployment:

1. Open `/health` and confirm an HTTP 200 response.
2. Complete viewer login and Chess.com account loading.
3. Complete streamer login and confirm the chat session is subscribed.
4. Add the permanent overlay URL to OBS and send a real Chzzk chat message.
5. Restart with `docker compose restart app` and confirm enabled chat sessions
   recover automatically.

## 6. Deploy an Update

After the GitHub workflow succeeds:

```sh
cd /opt/chessbadge/repository
git pull --ff-only
cd deploy
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
docker image prune -f
```

Check `docker compose ps` and application logs after every update.

## 7. Roll Back

Every build also has an immutable `sha-<commit>` tag. Change
`CHESSBADGE_IMAGE` in `deploy/.env` to the previous tag and run:

```sh
docker compose pull app
docker compose up -d app
```

Change the value back to `latest` only after the failing release is fixed.

## 8. Minimum Operations Checklist

- Enable Lightsail instance metric alarms and an external `/health` monitor.
- Configure AWS and Firebase budget alerts; alerts do not automatically cap cost.
- Keep Ubuntu security updates current and reboot during a planned window.
- Never commit `deploy/.env`, service-account JSON, or private keys.
- Retain at most the required Docker images and inspect disk usage periodically.
- Test a full instance reboot before inviting external beta users.
