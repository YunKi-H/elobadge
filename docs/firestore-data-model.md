# Firestore Data Model

EloBadge uses top-level collections with deterministic document IDs for the
lookups that happen on every chat message. Firestore access belongs to Fastify;
the browser does not read or write these collections directly.

## Collections

```text
users/{firebaseUid}
platformAccounts/{platform}:{platformUserId}
streamers/{firebaseUid}
chzzkTokens/{firebaseUid}
twitchTokens/{firebaseUid}
overlays/{publicToken}
chessAccounts/{accountId}
chessAccounts/{accountId}/ratings/{speed}
chessVerificationChallenges/{accountId}
```

### `users/{firebaseUid}`

The service user created after a successful Chzzk or Twitch custom-auth login.

```ts
{
  displayName: string;
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  updatedAt: Timestamp;
}
```

### `platformAccounts/{platform}:{platformUserId}`

Maps a Chzzk or Twitch identity to one EloBadge user. The deterministic document
ID and transactional writes prevent the same platform identity from being
claimed by multiple users.

```ts
{
  userId: string;
  platform: "chzzk" | "twitch";
  platformUserId: string;
  displayName: string;
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  updatedAt: Timestamp;
}
```

Chess badges and the selected provider belong to `users/{firebaseUid}`. Chat
lookups resolve the platform account to its EloBadge user before reading that
user's badge state.

### `streamers/{firebaseUid}`

Created when the user authorizes chat collection for at least one broadcasting
platform. It owns the stable overlay pointer and also contains Chzzk-specific
session intent when Chzzk is connected. Viewer-only login does not create this
document. Existing streamer documents remain when the same user logs in as a
viewer or disconnects one platform.

```ts
{
  chzzkChannelId?: string;
  displayName: string;
  chatSessionEnabled?: boolean;
  tokenStatus?: "active" | "reauth_required";
  tokenErrorAt?: Timestamp | null;
  disconnectedAt?: Timestamp;
  sessionUpdatedAt?: Timestamp;
  overlayToken: string;
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  updatedAt: Timestamp;
}
```

`chatSessionEnabled` records the streamer's desired state, not the current
WebSocket state. A manual stop sets it to `false`; server shutdown does not. On
startup, the server restores documents where it is `true` and the token status
is `active`.

Disconnecting Chzzk first stops the live session and revokes the refresh token
through Chzzk. Only a successful remote revoke deletes
`chzzkTokens/{firebaseUid}` and sets `chatSessionEnabled` to false,
`tokenStatus` to `reauth_required`, and `disconnectedAt`. A revoke or token
decryption failure preserves the encrypted token document so the operation can
be retried with the matching app credentials and encryption key.

### `chzzkTokens/{firebaseUid}`

Server-only OAuth credentials for a streamer.

Viewer OAuth credentials are never stored in this collection. Streamer tokens
are encrypted with AES-256-GCM and authenticated against their Firebase UID and
token kind before being written. `scope` preserves the provider response as-is.

```ts
{
  encryptedAccessToken: string;
  encryptedRefreshToken: string;
  tokenType: string;
  expiresAt: Timestamp;
  scope: string | null;
  encryptionVersion: 1;
  updatedAt: Timestamp;
}
```

Never return this document to the browser. Token encryption keys belong in the
server environment or a secret manager, not in Firestore.

Access tokens are refreshed five minutes before expiration. Chzzk refresh tokens
are one-time credentials, so a successful refresh always replaces both encrypted
token fields. The current in-process refresh lock assumes one ECS server task.

### `overlays/{publicToken}`

```ts
{
  streamerUid: string;
  active: boolean;
  theme: {
    backgroundVisible: boolean;
    chatAlignment: "left" | "center" | "right";
    messageLayout: "inline" | "stacked" | "aligned" | "individual";
    nicknameSeparatorVisible: boolean;
    alignedNicknameRightAligned: boolean;
    messageBoxFilled: boolean;
    backgroundColor: string; // #RRGGBB
    backgroundOpacity: number; // integer from 0 through 100
    platformBadgeSettings: {
      chzzk: {
        visible: boolean;
        visibility: {
          role: boolean;
          subscription: boolean;
          donation: boolean;
          subscription_gift: boolean;
          unknown: boolean;
        };
      };
      twitch: {
        visible: boolean;
        visibility: {
          role: boolean;
          subscription: boolean;
          donation: boolean;
          subscription_gift: boolean;
          unknown: boolean;
        };
      };
    };
    nicknameVisible: boolean;
    nicknameColorMode: "fixed" | "by_user" | "by_role";
    nicknameColor: string; // #RRGGBB, used by fixed mode
    nicknameRoleColors: {
      streamer: string;
      manager: string;
      donator: string;
      subscriber: string;
      viewer: string;
    }; // #RRGGBB values used by role mode
    messageColorMode: "fixed" | "by_role";
    messageColor: string; // #RRGGBB, used by fixed mode
    messageRoleColors: {
      streamer: string;
      manager: string;
      donator: string;
      subscriber: string;
      viewer: string;
    }; // #RRGGBB values used by role mode
    fontFamily:
      | "system"
      | "pretendard"
      | "freesentation"
      | "paperlogy"

      | "nanum_square_round"
      | "jalnan"
      | "maru_buri"
      | "nanum_gothic"
      | "nanum_myeongjo"
      | "chosun_gungseo"
      | "mona12"
      | "dohyeon";
    fontSizePx: number; // integer from 12 through 36
    fontWeight: 400 | 500 | 600 | 700 | 900;
    fontLineHeight: 1.2 | 1.4 | 1.6;
    messageDurationSeconds: 0 | 10 | 20 | 30 | 60; // 0 keeps messages visible
  };
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  updatedAt: Timestamp;
}
```

Theme documents written before platform-specific badge settings used
`platformBadgesVisible` and `platformBadgeVisibility`. The server reads that
shared value for both Chzzk and Twitch until the theme is saved in the new
`platformBadgeSettings` shape. The browser keeps at most the latest 30 messages
regardless of the duration.
Documents without `chatAlignment` use left alignment.
Documents without `messageLayout` use the existing single-line layout.
Documents without `nicknameSeparatorVisible` show the existing colon separator.
Documents without `alignedNicknameRightAligned` keep the nickname column left-aligned.
Documents without `messageBoxFilled` preserve the previous behavior: filled for
`aligned`, fitted to content for the other layouts.

The random document ID is the OBS browser-source token. It must be long enough
to resist guessing and must be replaceable from the streamer dashboard. Rotation
copies the appearance to a new document and deletes the previous document in the
same transaction. Disabling marks the current document inactive but retains it
so enabling can restore the same OBS URL. The current token is stored on
`streamers/{firebaseUid}.overlayToken` for a direct authenticated dashboard
lookup.

Fastify scans inactive overlay documents shortly after startup and every 24
hours. It preserves a document only when its ID still matches the owning
streamer's current `overlayToken`; malformed, ownerless, and superseded inactive
documents are deleted in batches of at most 400. A single-process lock prevents
overlapping cleanup scans.

Legacy documents with an empty `theme` use the default appearance. Rotating an
overlay token copies the current theme to the new document. Saving appearance
settings publishes an SSE `appearance` event so an open OBS browser source can
update without changing its URL or reloading the page.

Public overlay and SSE paths contain this bearer token. Application and
infrastructure access logs must redact the token path segment.

### `chessAccounts/{accountId}`

`accountId` is generated from the provider and normalized provider username.

```ts
{
  uid: string;
  provider: "lichess" | "chesscom";
  username: string;
  normalizedUsername: string;
  providerUserId: string | null;
  verifiedAt: Timestamp | null;
  verificationMethod: string | null;
  selectedSpeed: "bullet" | "blitz" | "rapid" | "classical" | null;
  profileUrl: string;
  avatarUrl: string | null;
  accountStatus: string;
  ratingsFetchedAt: Timestamp;
  nextRatingRefreshAt: Timestamp;
  manualRefreshAvailableAt: Timestamp;
  lastRatingRefreshAttemptAt: Timestamp;
  ratingRefreshStatus: "idle" | "refreshing" | "failed";
  ratingRefreshFailureCount: number;
  lastRatingRefreshError?: string;
  ratingRefreshLeaseId?: string;
  ratingRefreshLeaseUntil?: Timestamp;
  disconnectedAt: Timestamp | null;
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  updatedAt: Timestamp;
}
```

Ratings live under `chessAccounts/{accountId}/ratings/{speed}`. Updating the
selected rating also updates `users/{firebaseUid}.chessBadges` and
`users/{firebaseUid}.preferredChessProvider`.

Only a verified account can set `selectedSpeed`. Verification automatically
chooses the numerically highest Bullet, Blitz, or Rapid rating and copies it to
the denormalized Chzzk badge. Ties prefer Rapid, then Blitz, then Bullet.
Refreshing the same Chess.com account recalculates and refreshes the badge;
changing accounts or losing all supported ratings clears it.

Verified Chess.com accounts refresh automatically after 12 hours with up to 30
minutes of random jitter. Fastify scans for due accounts every 15 minutes and
processes PubAPI calls serially. Failed attempts retry with exponential backoff
from 5 minutes to 6 hours while preserving the last valid rating and badge. A
2-minute Firestore lease prevents duplicate work across concurrent server tasks
and expires automatically after an interrupted refresh. Manual refreshes use a
persisted 5-minute cooldown shared across browsers and server restarts.

Disconnecting clears the user pointer and Chzzk badge, then deletes the pending
challenge, Chess.com account, and all supported rating documents in one
transaction. Reconnecting fetches the public profile again and requires a new
ownership verification.

For Chess.com, the first registration uses the read-only PubAPI and therefore
always writes `verifiedAt: null`. A public username and public rating are not
proof of account ownership. Unverified accounts must never populate the
denormalized Chzzk badge. The initial supported Chess.com rating documents are
`bullet`, `blitz`, and `rapid`; Chess.com Daily is not mapped to classical.

The owning user stores a direct pointer at
`users/{firebaseUid}.chessAccountIds.chesscom`. This avoids a collection query
when loading the viewer settings page. A rating document contains:

```ts
{
  speed: "bullet" | "blitz" | "rapid";
  value: number;
  ratingDeviation: number;
  providerUpdatedAt: Timestamp;
  fetchedAt: Timestamp;
}
```

Lichess uses `users/{firebaseUid}.chessAccountIds.lichess` and deterministic
IDs in the form `lichess:{normalizedUsername}`. OAuth PKCE verifies ownership
immediately with `verificationMethod: "oauth_pkce"`; the temporary access token
is revoked after `/api/account` and is never stored. Its rating documents are
`bullet`, `blitz`, `rapid`, and `classical`, and additionally store `games` and
`provisional`. `users/{firebaseUid}.activeChessProvider` records which linked
provider currently supplies the denormalized chat badge.

### `chessVerificationChallenges/{accountId}`

Chess.com ownership verification asks the viewer to temporarily place a
one-time code in the public profile Location field. The challenge document is
server-only and stores only the SHA-256 hash of that code.

```ts
{
  uid: string;
  accountId: string;
  provider: "chesscom";
  providerUserId: string;
  codeHash: string;
  failedAttempts: number;
  expiresAt: Timestamp;
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  lastAttemptAt?: Timestamp;
}
```

Creating a new challenge replaces the previous one. Challenges expire after 48
hours and allow at most ten failed checks. Confirmation must match the current
user, account document, stable Chess.com player ID, and an exact trimmed
Location value before setting `verificationMethod: "profile_location"`.
Successful verification deletes the challenge document. PubAPI caching can
delay visibility of a newly edited Location, so a mismatch is retryable and
does not consume or replace the challenge immediately.

The application rejects expired challenges immediately. Because the Firebase
project remains on the Spark plan, the Fastify process also queries and deletes
up to 100 expired challenge documents shortly after startup and every six
hours. A single-process lock prevents overlapping cleanup scans. This avoids
the billing requirement of Firestore's managed TTL feature while keeping
abandoned challenges bounded.

## Account Deletion

`DELETE /api/account` requires a Firebase ID token whose UID exactly matches
`chzzk:{chzzkChannelId}`. The server stops any active chat session, attempts to
revoke stored Chzzk credentials, and then deletes every overlay document owned
by the user, linked platform accounts, the linked Chess.com and Lichess accounts
and ratings, a pending verification challenge, `chzzkTokens`, `twitchTokens`,
`streamers`, and `users`. It closes open SSE overlay connections and removes
the Firebase Authentication user last.

Dependent documents are deleted before the identity documents so a failed
request can be retried without losing the pointers needed for cleanup. Remote
Chzzk revocation is best effort: a provider outage is logged but does not block
deletion of locally stored credentials and personal data. Firestore batches are
limited below the 500-operation maximum, making retries idempotent after a
partial multi-batch cleanup.

## Chat Lookup

```text
Chzzk CHAT event
  -> platformAccounts/chzzk:{senderChannelId}
  -> users/{firebaseUid}.chessBadges
  -> in-memory or Redis cache
  -> SSE overlay event
```

Do not store every Chzzk chat message in Firestore. Chat is transient overlay
traffic; Firestore stores identities, configuration, verification, and ratings.
The server caches `senderChannelId -> badge` lookups for 60 seconds, coalesces
concurrent misses for the same sender, and invalidates the local entry after a
badge selection or account refresh. Firestore failures must not drop chat; the
message is published without a rating badge instead.
